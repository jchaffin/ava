# Skin Analysis API Documentation

## Overview

The Skin Analysis API provides AI-powered skin analysis capabilities for the e-commerce application. This API processes user-uploaded images to analyze skin type, identify concerns, and provide personalized product recommendations.

## ðŸ”’ Privacy & Security

**IMPORTANT: This API is designed with privacy-first principles.**

- âœ… **No File Storage**: User uploads are processed in memory only
- âœ… **No Disk Writes**: Images are never saved to the server's file system
- âœ… **Automatic Cleanup**: Images are discarded from memory after processing
- âœ… **Secure Processing**: All analysis happens in memory and is not persisted

## Usage Examples

### JavaScript/Fetch
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('image', imageFile);

const response = await fetch('/api/skin-analysis', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log(result);
```

### cURL
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -F "image=@path/to/image.jpg" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/skin-analysis
```

## Technical Details

### Image Processing
- Images are converted to Buffer in memory
- No temporary files are created
- Processing happens entirely in RAM
- Memory is automatically cleaned up after processing

### Supported Formats
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Recommended: Under 5MB for optimal performance

### Analysis Features
- Skin type detection
- Concern identification
- Personalized recommendations
- Confidence scoring
- Unique analysis tracking

## Security Considerations

1. **No Persistent Storage**: Images are never written to disk
2. **Memory Only**: All processing happens in application memory
3. **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory is freed after processing
4. **Input Validation**: File type and size validation
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without data leakage

## Performance Notes

- Processing time: ~2-3 seconds (mock analysis)
- Memory usage: Temporary, proportional to image size
- No disk I/O operations
- Scalable for concurrent requests

## Development Notes

- Uses mock AI analysis for development
- Configurable for different AI providers (Google Vision, Azure, OpenAI)
- Easy to extend with additional analysis features
- Built with TypeScript for type safety
